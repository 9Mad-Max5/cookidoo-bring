# cookidoo-bring
It should make it possible to add stuff from your shopping list in cookidoo to the shopping app bring. In the future it may be interesting to make it possible to integrate with other apps like KitchenOwl or sth like that but for the moment is the focus on bring as it is quite versatile and used almost on any platform.

Ideal it should be used in a headless browser so it can be run of a docker and therefore make a one direction import as a first approach as a cron. A dual sync is the final goal.
