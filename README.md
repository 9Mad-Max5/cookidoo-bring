## üîÅ How It Works

1. Logs into your Cookidoo account using Playwright (headless browser)
2. Scrapes the current shopping list items
3. Normalizes/combines quantities where appropriate
4. Pushes items to the selected Bring! list
5. Optionally merges similar items
6. Marks items as transferred on Cookidoo to avoid duplicates


## üß™ Local Development

You need **Python 3.11+**.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python bring_sync.py
```


## üìÖ Usage Scenarios

- Keep your Bring shopping list up to date with your planned Cookidoo meals.
- Syncs quantities in a smart way (e.g. adds amounts together instead of duplicating items).
- Can be scheduled on a server or NAS to run continuously.
